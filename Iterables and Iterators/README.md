## Iterables and Iterators
> **You are given a list of N lowercase English letters. For a given integer K, you can select any K indices (assume 1-based indexing) with a uniform probability from the list.
<br/>Find the probability that at least one of the K indices selected will contain the letter: 'a'.<br/>**

**Input Format**<br/>
The input consists of three lines. The first line contains the integer N, denoting the length of the list. The next line consists of N space-separated lowercase English letters, denoting the elements of the list.<br/>The third and the last line of input contains the integer K, denoting the number of indices to be selected.<br/>

**Output Format** <br/>
Output a single line consisting of the probability that at least one of the K indices selected contains the letter:'a'.<br/>Note: The answer must be correct up to 3 decimal places.<br/>
