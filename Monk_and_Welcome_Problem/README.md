## Monk and Welcome Problem
> **Having a good previous year, Monk is back to teach algorithms and data structures. This year he welcomes the learners with a problem which he calls "Welcome Problem". The problem gives you two arrays A and B (each array of size N) and asks to print new array C such that:
C[i] = A[i] + B[i]; 1<= i<= N
<br/>
Now, Monk will proceed further when you solve this one. So, go on and solve it :)**

**Input Format**<br/>
First line consists of an integer N, denoting the size of A and B.<br/>
Next line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.<br/>
Next line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array B.<br/><br/>
**Output Format** <br/>
Print N space separated integers denoting the array C.<br/><br/>

**Constraints**<br/>
1<= N <=100000<br/>
1<= A[i] <= 100000; 1<= i<= N<br/>
1<= B[i] <= 100000; 1<= i<= N<br/><br/>
