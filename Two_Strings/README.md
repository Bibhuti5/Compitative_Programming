## Two Strings
> **Given two strings of equal length, you have to tell whether they both strings are identical.
<br/>
Two strings S1 and S2 are said to be identical, if any of the permutation of string S1 is equal to the string S2. See Sample explanation for more details.**

**Input Format**<br/>
First line, contains an intger 'T' denoting no. of test cases.<br/>
Each test consists of a single line, containing two space separated strings S1 and S2 of equal length.<br/><br/>

**Output Format** <br/>
For each test case, if any of the permutation of string S1 is equal to the string S2 print YES else print NO.<br/>

**Constraints**<br/>
1<= T <=100<br/>
1<= |S1| = |S2| <= 10^5<br/>
String is made up of lower case letters only.<br/><br/>
