## Count Bigger
> **You will be given an array and you need to find the smallest and second smallest numbers and add them.<br/>The length of the array should not be less than 2.<br/>Expected Time Complexity - O(n) **

**Input Format**<br/>
You will be taking a number as an input stdin which tells about the length of the array. On another line, array elements should be there with single space between them.<br/>

**Output Format** <br/>
You need to print the addition of smallest and second smallest element to the stdout.<br/>

**Constraints**<br/>
2 <= L <= 1000<br/>
1 <= Ai <= 1000<br/>
